# CLAUDE.md — FrankClaw Development Guide

## Project

FrankClaw is a security-hardened Rust rewrite of OpenClaw (a TypeScript AI assistant gateway). It connects messaging channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc.) to AI model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) via a local WebSocket gateway.

## Build & Test

```bash
cargo check          # Type-check the whole workspace
cargo test           # Run all tests (~920)
cargo build          # Build everything (debug)
cargo build -r       # Build release (LTO, stripped)
cargo build -p frankclaw  # Build just the CLI binary
```

The binary is at `target/debug/frankclaw` (or `target/release/frankclaw`).

## Code Conventions

- **Edition 2024**, MSRV Rust 1.93+
- `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` on every crate — no exceptions
- All errors use `thiserror` with explicit variants (no catch-all `anyhow` in library crates)
- Secrets wrapped in `secrecy::SecretString` (zeroed on drop, `[REDACTED]` in Debug)
- Async runtime: `tokio` with structured concurrency (`CancellationToken`, `JoinSet`)
- Config hot-reload via `arc_swap::ArcSwap` (lock-free pointer swap)
- Concurrent maps: `dashmap::DashMap` (sharded locking)
- All file I/O permissions: `0o600` (owner-only) for sensitive data, `0o700` for directories
- Token comparison always constant-time
- No `.unwrap()` in production code; use `.expect("invariant: reason")` only for provably safe cases

## Feature Development Rules

- When adding new features, refactor where it makes sense instead of duplicating logic.
- Abstract shared behavior once there are multiple call sites or a clear stable boundary.
- Prefer small, composable components over large feature-specific codepaths.
- Every feature addition should include unit tests for the new behavior and any extracted shared logic.
- Treat regression resistance as part of feature work: do not land new capability without test coverage that protects the existing path.

## Internationalization (i18n)

All user-facing text in the CLI (`crates/frankclaw-cli`) is internationalized using `rust-i18n`. Translations live in `crates/frankclaw-cli/locales/` as YAML files (v1 format: `_version: 1`, flat dotted keys, one file per locale). Supported locales: en, pt-BR, pt-PT, es, fr, de, it, ja, ko.

**Rules:**

- **Always use `t!()` for user-facing strings.** Never hardcode English text in `println!`, `eprintln!`, `.context()`, or error messages that users see. Use `t!("key.path", var = value)` with `%{var}` interpolation in YAML.
- **Keep all locale files in sync.** When adding or modifying a user-facing string, update `en.yml` first, then update all other locale files with the translated equivalent. Never leave a translation key present in `en.yml` but missing from other locales.
- **Code stays in English.** Variable names, comments, function names, and internal error messages remain in English. Only text displayed to the end user goes through i18n.
- **System prompts stay in English.** LLM system prompts are NOT translated. Instead, `build_system_prompt()` in `frankclaw-runtime` appends a "respond in {language}" instruction when `FRANKCLAW_LANG` is set to a non-English locale.
- **YAML format:** Use `_version: 1` flat dotted keys (e.g., `setup.title: "FrankClaw Setup"`). Do NOT use locale root keys or nested YAML — rust-i18n v1 format requires flat keys with the locale inferred from the filename.
- **Test impact:** Tests that check for specific English substrings in output will work because the default/fallback locale is "en". If you add new tests checking string content, use the English translation text.

## Security Rules

- Gateway **refuses** to bind to non-loopback addresses without auth configured (hard error, not a warning)
- SSRF protection on all outbound HTTP: blocks private IPs, CGNAT, link-local, documentation ranges
- Media filenames sanitized (path traversal prevention, leading dots stripped)
- Passwords hashed with Argon2id (t=3, m=64MB, p=4)
- Session transcripts encrypted at rest with ChaCha20-Poly1305 when master key is provided
- Bash tool execution controlled by `BashPolicy` (deny-all default) + optional `ai-jail` sandbox
- `FRANKCLAW_SANDBOX=ai-jail` or `ai-jail-lockdown` wraps commands in bubblewrap+landlock isolation
- `frankclaw audit` reports severity-rated findings (CRIT/HIGH/MED/LOW/INFO) with CI exit codes
- Prompt injection sanitization: Unicode control/format chars (Cc, Cf) stripped from all user input and tool output before LLM ingestion
- Total prompt size hard-capped at 2 MB (`MAX_PROMPT_BYTES`) to prevent token exhaustion DoS
- External content wrapping: `wrap_untrusted_text()` and `wrap_external_content()` for marking data boundaries
- Optional VirusTotal malware scanning on file uploads (enabled via `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY`)

## Key Paths

## Input Validation & Injection Prevention

Every feature in FrankClaw must follow these rules to keep the security posture intact. **Read this before writing any code that handles external data.**

### Rule 1: All user-facing identifiers must be length-bounded

`AgentId`, `ChannelId`, `SessionKey`, sender IDs, account IDs — any string that arrives from an HTTP request, WebSocket message, or webhook payload must be clamped to a safe maximum (255 bytes for IDs, 800 for composite keys). This is enforced in `frankclaw-core/src/types.rs` via `clamp_id()`. Never create a new identifier type without a length limit.

### Rule 2: All text inputs must be size-checked before processing

User messages, canvas content, webhook bodies — every text payload must be validated against a maximum size before being stored, forwarded to an LLM, or processed. The `max_webhook_body_bytes` config (default 1MB) is the canonical limit. WebSocket `chat_send()` enforces this too. If you add a new input path, add a size check.

### Rule 3: Never pass user data to `sh -c` without metacharacter filtering

The bash tool's allowlist rejects commands containing shell metacharacters (`;`, `|`, `&`, `` ` ``, `$`, `()`, `{}`, `<>`, `!`, newlines). This prevents allowlist bypass attacks like `echo; rm -rf /`. If you modify the bash tool or add a new command execution path, **never** rely solely on first-word extraction — always reject metacharacters in allowlist mode.

### Rule 4: Never interpolate user data into system prompts

System prompts are built from config values and static templates only (`crates/frankclaw-runtime/src/prompts.rs`). The `render()` function replaces `{placeholder}` with values — **all values must come from trusted sources** (config, computed metadata). User messages must only appear in `Role::User` message slots, never concatenated into the system prompt string. If you add new prompt templates, verify that no user-controlled data flows into `render()` vars.

### Rule 5: Tool arguments are untrusted (they come from the LLM)

When the LLM returns tool calls, the tool name and arguments are attacker-influenced. Tool names are validated against the agent's allowlist before invocation. Tool arguments are JSON-parsed and passed to tool implementations. Each tool must validate its own arguments defensively — never trust shape, size, or content of LLM-generated tool args.

### Rule 6: Subagent task/label are sanitized and truncated

Subagent spawn requests include `task` and `label` strings that get embedded in the subagent's system prompt context. These are sanitized (Unicode control chars stripped) and truncated to 2000 chars in `build_subagent_context()`. If you add new fields to `SpawnRequest` that flow into prompts, apply `sanitize_for_prompt()` and truncation.

### Rule 6a: All text entering the LLM context must be sanitized

User messages, tool outputs, subagent tasks, and any other text that flows into the LLM prompt must pass through `sanitize::sanitize_for_prompt()` from `frankclaw-runtime/src/sanitize.rs`. This strips Unicode control characters (Cc category) and format characters (Cf category — zero-width chars, bidi overrides, soft hyphens, etc.) that can be used for prompt injection. Whitespace characters (\t, \n, \r) are preserved. If you add a new input path that feeds text into `CompletionMessage` content, sanitize it.

### Rule 6b: External content must be wrapped in boundary tags

When fetching external content (URLs, media, API responses) that will be shown to the LLM, wrap it with `sanitize::wrap_external_content(source, content)`. This applies sanitization and adds `<external-content>` tags that create a semantic boundary. For user-provided text that isn't a direct chat message, use `sanitize::wrap_untrusted_text(text)`. These helpers are in `frankclaw-runtime/src/sanitize.rs`.

### Rule 6c: Total prompt size must be bounded

The total prompt (system + all messages) must not exceed `MAX_PROMPT_BYTES` (2 MB). This is enforced in `Runtime::chat()` via `sanitize::check_prompt_size()`. If you add a new chat path or allow direct prompt construction, enforce this limit.

### Rule 7: All SQL queries must use parameterized statements

Every query in `frankclaw-sessions` uses `rusqlite::params![]` bindings. Never concatenate user data into SQL strings. This is already clean — keep it that way.

### Rule 8: All outbound HTTP must go through SSRF protection

Any URL fetched on behalf of a user must go through `SafeFetcher::fetch()` or `validate_url_ssrf()` from `frankclaw-media`. This blocks private IPs, loopback, CGNAT, link-local, and documentation ranges. Never use raw `reqwest::get()` on user-provided URLs.

### Rule 9: Media filenames must be sanitized

File uploads go through `sanitize_filename()` in `frankclaw-media/src/store.rs` which strips path separators, leading dots, and limits length to 60 chars. If you add a new file storage path, use the same sanitizer.

### Rule 10: Files from untrusted sources should be scanned

When a `FileScanService` is configured (currently VirusTotal via `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY`), `MediaStore::store()` automatically scans files before writing to disk. Use `store()` (not `store_unscanned()`) for any file originating from external sources: user uploads, channel attachments, downloaded URLs, email attachments. Use `store_unscanned()` only for internally generated content like screenshots or server-rendered outputs. The `scan_file()` method is available for scanning files that pass through without storage (forwarded attachments). The `FileScanService` trait in `frankclaw-core/src/media.rs` allows plugging in alternative scanners (ClamAV, etc.).

### Rule 11: Canvas HTML is stripped on export

Canvas content is stored as-is but `strip_html_tags()` runs on export to prevent XSS. If you add a new output path for canvas content (API endpoint, channel message), ensure HTML stripping runs before output.

## Parity Work Process

When working through `docs/PARITY_TODO.md` features:

1. **One feature at a time** — complete, test, commit before starting the next.
2. **Compare with OpenClaw** (`openclaw/` directory) for functional requirements, but do NOT copy 1:1. Prefer Rust idioms, slim design, and security hardening over feature-identical ports.
3. **Drop what's unnecessary** — if an OpenClaw feature is over-engineered, Node-specific, or adds complexity without clear value, skip it and note why in the TODO.
4. **Add tests** for every new feature. Tests must pass before committing.
5. **Commit per feature** with a clear message describing what was added.
6. **Update `docs/PARITY_TODO.md`** — mark the feature done and add notes on what was implemented vs dropped.
7. **Follow priority order** in `docs/PARITY_TODO.md` (Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3 → Tier 4).
8. **Frontend**: if UI is needed, keep it slim (TypeScript + Tailwind, no heavy frameworks).

## CI Expectations

- `cargo check` must pass with zero errors
- `cargo test` must pass all tests
