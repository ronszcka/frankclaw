# FrankClaw Parity TODO

This file tracks the remaining distance between FrankClaw and the broader OpenClaw feature surface.
It should stay current as features land, are deferred, or are explicitly dropped.

**Last verified**: 2026-03-11 — systematic directory-by-directory audit of OpenClaw `src/` (~192k LOC
across ~2,864 non-test TypeScript files) against FrankClaw (~27k LOC across 13 Rust crates).

## Current Position

FrankClaw has been audited against OpenClaw's battle-tested implementation.
See `AUDIT_PLAN.md` for the full audit results across all 14 components.
It now has a working hardened core with:

- inbound/outbound assistant loop
- session persistence and optional transcript encryption
- provider failover
- DM pairing and stricter channel defaults
- local console UI
- cron reuse
- signed webhooks
- bounded tool execution
- local Canvas host
- operator onboarding and install helpers

FrankClaw covers the **core message-to-model flow** well but is missing many
of OpenClaw's advanced subsystems. The gap is primarily in runtime intelligence,
extensibility, and multimodal capabilities — not the transport/plumbing layer.

## Missing or Partial vs OpenClaw

### Agent Intelligence Layer

These are the core "brain" features that make OpenClaw's agent loop sophisticated:

- [x] **Context Engine** — Sliding window compaction with token estimation, message pruning,
  tool pairing repair, and summary marker insertion. (`frankclaw-runtime/src/context.rs`)

- [x] **Context Compaction** — Automatic context window management with safety margins,
  per-message overhead estimation, and orphaned tool result cleanup.

- [x] **Subagent System** — Hierarchical agent spawning with depth limits, concurrency control,
  lifecycle tracking (pending → running → completed/failed/killed), push-based completion
  notification, and system prompt context injection. (`frankclaw-runtime/src/subagent.rs`)

- [x] **Auto-Reply Command System** — Prefix-based command detection (`/cmd`), alias resolution,
  inline directive extraction (`/think`, `/model`), help generation, and dispatch pipeline
  with bypass-model capability. (`frankclaw-runtime/src/commands.rs`)

- [x] **System Prompt Construction** — Dynamic system prompt assembly from identity, user prompt,
  tool listing, skills, safety rules, and runtime metadata. (`frankclaw-runtime/src/lib.rs`)

### Multimodal & Content Understanding

- [x] **Media Understanding** — Vision description via OpenAI-compatible vision API, audio
  transcription via Whisper API, media kind classification, attachment processing pipeline
  with size limits and graceful error handling. (`frankclaw-media/src/understanding.rs`,
  `frankclaw-core/src/media.rs`)

- [x] **Link Understanding** — SSRF-safe URL extraction from messages with deduplication,
  markdown link stripping, and private IP/hostname blocking. (`frankclaw-core/src/links.rs`)

- [x] **TTS (Text-to-Speech)** — **SKIPPED**: voice output is a gimmick, not core functionality.

### Extensibility & Hooks

- [x] **Hooks System** — Event-driven hook registry with 5 event types (command, session, agent,
  gateway, message), async fire-and-forget execution, general and specific event matching,
  30s timeout per handler, typed event constructors. (`frankclaw-core/src/hooks.rs`)

- [x] **Gmail Integration** — **SKIPPED**: complex Google Pub/Sub integration for a niche channel.

- [x] **Skills System** — Workspace-loaded skill manifests with validation, capability-based
  tool access control, and prompt injection. (`frankclaw-plugin-sdk/src/lib.rs`)

- [x] **ACP (Agent Client Protocol)** — **SKIPPED**: niche interop standard with no real-world adoption.

### Runtime & Execution

- [ ] **Sandboxed Agent Runtime** — Docker-based execution
  OpenClaw has full Docker container sandboxing with path policies, media path mapping,
  tool policy enforcement, per-agent sandbox config, workspace-only mode. FrankClaw has
  no sandboxing.

- [x] **Bash Tools** — Shell command execution with timeout enforcement, output truncation,
  working directory support, and configurable security policy (deny-all, allow-all, or
  binary allowlist). (`frankclaw-tools/src/bash.rs`)

- [x] **Model Catalog & Discovery** — Static catalog with known metadata (context windows, costs,
  capabilities) for OpenAI and Anthropic models. Enrichment fallback for unknown models with
  conservative API-specific defaults. (`frankclaw-models/src/catalog.rs`)

- [x] **Auth Profile Rotation** — Multi-key per provider with round-robin selection, exponential
  backoff on failure, automatic recovery on cooldown expiry, and provider-level key management.
  (`frankclaw-core/src/api_keys.rs`)

- [ ] **Vector Memory Backend** — Persistent memory search
  OpenClaw's context engine supports vector memory for long-term knowledge retrieval.
  FrankClaw has a `frankclaw-memory` crate with traits defined but no backend.

### Channel Features

- [x] **Polls** — **SKIPPED**: marginal value channel-specific feature.

- [x] **WhatsApp Web** — **SKIPPED**: Baileys/WA Web Socket is fragile; Cloud API covers the use case.

### Secrets & Security

- [ ] **Secrets Management** — Full secrets audit and management
  OpenClaw has secret audit, auth profile scanning, credential matrix, JSON pointer
  resolution, configure plan, runtime auth collectors, provider env var mapping.
  FrankClaw has `SecretString` wrapping but no secrets audit/management CLI.

- [ ] **Security Audit** — Automated config security scanning
  OpenClaw has automated security scanning: dangerous config flags, mutable allowlist
  detectors, skill scanner, safe regex validation, external content analysis, tool
  policy audit. FrankClaw has SSRF protection and input validation but no automated
  security scanning.

### Operator Experience

- [x] **Daemon Management** — `frankclaw start/stop/status` with PID file tracking, log
  redirection, graceful SIGTERM shutdown with SIGKILL fallback. Also retains systemd unit
  generation for production deployments.

- [x] **Interactive Setup Wizard** — `frankclaw setup` with guided provider selection
  (OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama), API key env var configuration, channel selection (6 channels),
  port choice, session encryption toggle, and automatic gateway token generation.

- [x] **Doctor Diagnostics** — comprehensive `frankclaw doctor` covering system info, config
  validation, state directory health, SQLite DB integrity, port availability, async provider
  connectivity checks, Unix file/directory permission audits, channel status, and security
  posture with structured PASS/WARN/FAIL/INFO output.

## Priority Tiers

### Tier 1 — Core Intelligence (high impact, needed for competitive parity)

1. ~~Context engine with compaction~~ ✅
2. ~~Media understanding pipeline~~ ✅
3. ~~System prompt construction~~ ✅
4. ~~Link understanding~~ ✅

### Tier 2 — Advanced Agent Capabilities

5. ~~Subagent system~~ ✅
6. ~~Auto-reply command system~~ ✅
7. ~~Model catalog/discovery~~ ✅
8. ~~Auth profile rotation~~ ✅

### Tier 3 — Extensibility

9. ~~Hooks system~~ ✅
10. ~~Skills system~~ ✅ (already implemented in plugin-sdk)
11. ~~ACP protocol~~ — **SKIPPED**: niche interop standard with no real-world adoption yet
12. ~~Bash tools with sandboxing~~ ✅

### Tier 4 — Operator Experience

13. ~~Doctor diagnostics~~ ✅ — comprehensive `frankclaw doctor` with system info, config
    validation, state dir health, SQLite integrity, port availability, provider connectivity,
    file permission audits, channel status, and security posture.
14. ~~Interactive setup wizard~~ ✅ — `frankclaw setup` guides through provider selection
    (OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama), API key config, channel selection, port, encryption.
15. ~~Process management~~ ✅ — `frankclaw start/stop` with PID file tracking, log redirection,
    graceful shutdown (SIGTERM → SIGKILL fallback), stale PID detection.

### Tier 4 — Skipped (low value or excessive effort)

- ~~TTS~~ — voice output is a gimmick, not core functionality
- ~~Polls~~ — channel-specific feature, marginal value
- ~~WhatsApp Web~~ — Baileys/WA Web Socket is fragile and complex; Cloud API covers the use case
- ~~Gmail integration~~ — complex Google Pub/Sub integration for a niche channel
- ~~Device pairing~~ — Bonjour/mDNS/Tailscale discovery is over-engineered for a self-hosted tool
- ~~Auto-update~~ — users can use their package manager or pull from git
- ~~Markdown IR~~ — channel-specific rendering can be added per-channel as needed
- ~~i18n~~ — English-first; translations can be contributed later without infrastructure now

### Deferred / Lower Priority

- Wider long-tail channel parity (Google Chat, iMessage, IRC, Teams, Matrix, etc.)
- Companion node/app surfaces
- Voice
- Distro-specific installers
- Secrets audit CLI
- Full TUI (FrankClaw has basic console; OpenClaw has full interactive client with session tabs, token display, syntax highlighting)
